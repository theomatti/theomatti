 <summary><h3>👨🏾‍💻 Theo's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  My passion for animation and anime led me to start creating animations using Adobe software. As I progressed, I discovered Adobe Flash and started experimenting with game development. This sparked my interest in coding and I started exploring different programming languages and game engines, including learning JavaScript and C++ on my own before starting university.

During my time at university, where I studied mathematics, I continued to develop my skills in Python and R, using them to solve mathematical problems and create simulations. I also used Unity and Unreal Engine to develop games, building upon the knowledge I gained from my previous experiences with game engines.

As I progressed through my studies, I realized that I wanted to pursue a career in software development. I started working on personal projects to improve my skills and build my portfolio, and I began contributing to open source projects to gain experience working with other developers.

I'm excited to continue my journey as a developer and see where it takes me next.
